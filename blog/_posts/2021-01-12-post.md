Kinda bug and kinda snack  
Try to catch 'em in your trap  
Feed somebody and you'll see  
We are whatever we eat  
Find 'em hiding in the sand  
Tearing up a ketchup patch  
Come to Snaktooth Island and  
Discover its Bugsnax

I heard that somewhere far off in the ocean  
There lies an island where the creatures roam  
A famed explorer tells me they're delicious and yet  
They're hitherto unknown

You might think it sounds impossible  
'Til you've seen a carrot crawl

Kinda bug and kinda snack  
Try to catch 'em in your trap  
Feed somebody and you'll see  
We are whatever we eat  
Find 'em hiding in the sand  
Tearing up a ketchup patch  
Come to Snaktooth Island and  
Discover its Bugsnax  

Oh-oo-oh  
It's Bugsnax  
Oh-oo-oh  
Talkin' 'bout Bugsnax  
Oh-oo-oh  
It's Bugsnax

And if the rumour's not complete baloney  
Then it's the story of the century  
So grab a journal listen up and make some new friends  
To solve the mystery

An expedition thirteen-strong  
Of Grumpuses who all set off  
Seeking out a better life  
On Snaktooth Island they did find  
A tasty quest to fill the hole  
That many feel inside their soul  
Venture deep to reach the truth  
And maybe you'll learn something too

You might think it sounds impossible  
'Til you've seen a sandwich climb a wall

Kinda bug and kinda snack  
Try to catch 'em in your trap  
Feed somebody and you'll see  
We are whatever we eat  
Find 'em hiding in the sand  
Tearing up a ketchup patch  
Come to Snaktooth Island and  
Discover its Bugsnax

Oh-oo-oh  
It's Bugsnax  
Oh-oo-oh  
Talkin' 'bout Bugsnax  
Oh-oo-oh  
It's Bugsnax  
Oh-oo-oh  
Everyone's talkin' 'bout Bugsnax  
It's Bugsnax
